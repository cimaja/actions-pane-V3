# Task ID: 5
# Title: Build Sub-Groups Support for Built-in Modules
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement support for sub-groups within built-in modules
# Details:
Create collapsible sub-groups for organizing large sets of actions. Add action count badges to sub-groups. Implement hover behavior for favoriting individual actions within sub-groups. Ensure proper nesting and visual hierarchy for sub-groups.

# Test Strategy:
Test collapsing and expanding of sub-groups. Verify action count badges display correctly. Check that only individual actions can be favorited, not sub-groups.
