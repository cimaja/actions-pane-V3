# Description: Create the main resizable panel for the Actions Pane with appropriate constraints
# Details:
Implement a resizable panel with default width of ~360px, minimum width of ~320px, and maximum width of ~500px. Ensure smooth resizing behavior with appropriate handles. Handle edge cases like window resizing and minimum window dimensions. Implement responsive behavior for different screen sizes.
