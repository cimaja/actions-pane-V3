# Power Automate Desktop - Actions Pane V4 Redesign

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a prototype for the redesigned Actions Pane in Power Automate Desktop, including its interaction with a Library Modal for managing built-in actions, connectors, custom actions, UI collections, and templates. The design prioritizes clarity, scalability, and user-friendly interaction using Fluent Design System components.

## Key Components

### 1. Actions Pane Layout
- Resizable panel (default: ~360px, min: ~320px, max: ~592px)
- Top section with search input and filter tabs/pills (All, Built-in, Connectors, Favorites)
- Filter icon for additional sorting/filtering options
- Default "All" view displaying installed assets grouped under headers
- Preloaded default modules across categories (Connectors, Files, Interaction, Logic, System)
- Support for sub-groups within built-in modules
- Favorites tab showing only starred actions

### 2. Library Entry Point
- Positioned at the bottom of the Actions Pane
- Opens the full Library Modal for action/module/template management

### 3. Library Modal
- Left navigation pane with categories (Built-in Actions, Connectors, Custom Actions, UI Collections, Templates)
- Content area displaying filtered items with logos, titles, and install status
- Detail view for each asset type
- Independent search functionality for each tab

### 4. Detail Views
- Module/Connector view: Logo, title, install/uninstall button, action list
- Custom Actions view: Logo, title, author info, description, install toggle
- UI Collections view: Logo, title, item count, contained elements
- Templates view: Title, description, author info, dependencies, preview

### 5. UX Considerations
- Actions Pane shows only installed/available items
- Personalization through Library
- Favoriting available on individual actions only
- Tooltips for descriptions
- Default items for first-time experience
- "See all" links to Library with appropriate filters
- Nested sub-groups for better scannability
- Fluent Design System implementation

## Technical Requirements
- Implement using Fluent Design System components
- Create responsive, resizable panels
- Implement collapsible groups and sub-groups
- Build search and filtering functionality
- Develop favoriting system with persistent state
- Create modal system for Library and detail views
- Implement install/uninstall functionality
- Build tooltip system for descriptions

## Success Metrics
- Improved discoverability of actions and connectors
- Reduced time to find and use actions
- Increased user satisfaction with organization
- Better scalability for growing action library
- Improved first-time user experience
