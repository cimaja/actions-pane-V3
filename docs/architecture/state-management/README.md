## State Management Overview

The Actions Pane V4 prototype uses a phased approach to state management:

### Phase 1: Current Implementation (Complete)

- React's built-in state management with `useState`
- State lifting for shared state
- Props drilling for data flow
- Data service for data access and filtering

### Phase 2: Enhanced Implementation (Next Steps)

- React Context API for UI state and user preferences
- Custom hooks for state logic
- Reducer pattern for predictable state updates
- Local storage for persistence

### Phase 3: Advanced Implementation (Future)

- Redux Toolkit for global state management
- React Query for server state
- Optimistic updates and caching
- State synchronization

## Key State Categories

1. **UI State**
   - Active tab selection
   - Search queries
   - Expanded/collapsed groups
   - Modal states

2. **User Preferences**
   - Favorite actions
   - Panel width
   - Default tab
   - Recently used actions

3. **Data State**
   - Modules and connectors
   - Actions and their metadata
   - Filtered content based on active tab and search

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these principles:

1. **Incremental Adoption**
   - Start with simple state management
   - Gradually introduce more advanced patterns
   - Maintain backward compatibility

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - UI state separate from user preferences
   - Data access through the data service
   - Business logic in appropriate layers

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Minimize unnecessary re-renders
   - Use memoization for expensive computations
   - Implement efficient state updates

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Clear patterns for state updates
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Comprehensive documentation

## Getting Started

To understand the state management approach, start with the [State Management Plan](./state-management-plan.md) document, which provides an overview of the state requirements and management approaches. Then, explore the [State Flow Diagrams](./state-flow-diagrams.md) to visualize how state flows through the application. Finally, review the [Implementation Guide](./implementation-guide.md) for practical implementation details and code examples.
