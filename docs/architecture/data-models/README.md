## Data Models Overview

The Actions Pane V4 prototype uses a set of well-defined data models to represent the various entities in the application:

### Core Data Models

- **ActionItemType**: Represents an individual action that can be performed
- **DetailedActionItem**: Extends ActionItemType with additional metadata
- **ActionGroup**: Represents a group of related actions
- **LibraryItemType**: Represents an item in the Library Modal

### Type Definitions

- **TabType**: Represents the tabs in the Actions Pane
- **LibraryCategoryType**: Represents the categories in the Library Modal

## Mock Data Structure

The mock data for the Actions Pane V4 prototype is organized in a modular structure:

```
src/data/mock/
├── modules/           # Built-in modules
├── connectors/        # Connectors
└── templates/         # Templates for creating new modules and connectors
```

Each module and connector follows a standard template, making it easy to add new mock data.

## Data Service

The data service provides a unified interface for accessing all data in the application. It encapsulates the logic for retrieving, filtering, and transforming data, hiding the implementation details from the components that consume the data.

Key features of the data service include:

- Centralized access to all data
- Methods for filtering and searching
- Support for user preferences (favorites)
- Integration with the component architecture

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these principles:

1. **Modular Structure**
   - Each module and connector is defined in its own file
   - Common patterns are extracted into templates
   - The data service provides a unified interface

2. **Type Safety**
   - All data models are defined as TypeScript interfaces
   - Type definitions ensure consistency
   - Generic types are used where appropriate

3. **Extensibility**
   - New modules and connectors can be easily added
   - The data service can be extended with new methods
   - The mock data structure can be expanded

4. **Maintainability**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Comprehensive documentation

## Getting Started

To understand the data models and mock data structure, start with the [Data Models](./data-models.md) document, which provides an overview of the core data models and their relationships. Then, explore the [Mock Data Structure](./mock-data-structure.md) document to understand how the mock data is organized and how to add new mock data. Finally, review the [Data Service](./data-service.md) document to understand how the data is accessed and manipulated in the application.
