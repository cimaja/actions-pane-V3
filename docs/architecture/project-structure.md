## Key Implementation Details

### Component Implementation

1. **ActionsPane**
   - Implemented as a resizable panel with a fixed width range
   - Uses Fluent UI components for consistent styling
   - Manages the state for active tab and search query

2. **ActionsPaneHeader**
   - Contains the search box and tab navigation
   - Uses Fluent UI's SearchBox and TabList components
   - Handles tab selection and search input

3. **ActionsPaneContent**
   - Renders action groups based on the active tab and search query
   - Uses Fluent UI's Accordion component for collapsible groups
   - Displays empty state when no content is available

4. **ActionItem**
   - Renders a single action item with icon, title, and favorite button
   - Uses Fluent UI's Tooltip component for displaying descriptions
   - Handles click events for the action and favorite button

### Data Implementation

1. **Modular Data Structure**
   - Each module and connector has its own file
   - Files export metadata and actions
   - Index files provide easy access to all modules and connectors

2. **Data Service**
   - Singleton service that provides access to all data
   - Initializes data from module and connector files
   - Provides methods for retrieving, filtering, and searching data

3. **Type Definitions**
   - Defined in `src/models/types.ts`
   - Provide type safety for all data structures
   - Used consistently throughout the application

### Styling Implementation

1. **Fluent UI Components**
   - Used for consistent styling and behavior
   - Provides accessibility and responsive design
   - Follows Microsoft's Fluent Design System

2. **Component-Specific Styles**
   - Implemented using Fluent UI's makeStyles hook
   - Scoped to individual components
   - Uses tokens for consistent colors, spacing, and typography

3. **Global Styles**
   - Defined in `src/styles/index.css` and `src/styles/App.css`
   - Provide reset styles and global variables
   - Set up the basic layout for the application

## Design Decisions

### Modular Data Structure

The decision to use a modular data structure with separate files for each module and connector was made to:

1. **Improve Maintainability**
   - Each module and connector can be edited independently
   - Changes to one module don't affect others
   - New modules and connectors can be added easily

2. **Enhance Scalability**
   - The application can handle a large number of modules and connectors
   - The structure can be extended to support new types of data
   - Performance remains good even with many items

3. **Support Collaboration**
   - Different team members can work on different modules
   - Merge conflicts are reduced
   - Code reviews are more focused

### Component Granularity

The decision to use a granular component structure was made to:

1. **Improve Reusability**
   - Small, focused components can be reused in different contexts
   - Components have clear responsibilities
   - Components are easier to test

2. **Enhance Maintainability**
   - Changes to one component don't affect others
   - Components can be refactored independently
   - Code is more modular and easier to understand

3. **Support Collaboration**
   - Different team members can work on different components
   - Components can be developed in parallel
   - Integration is simpler with well-defined interfaces

### State Management Approach

The decision to use React's built-in state management was made to:

1. **Keep Things Simple**
   - The current complexity level doesn't warrant a state management library
   - React's useState and useEffect hooks are sufficient
   - The application is easier to understand and debug

2. **Minimize Dependencies**
   - Fewer dependencies mean fewer potential issues
   - The application is more stable
   - Updates are easier to manage

3. **Maintain Flexibility**
   - The approach can be extended as needed
   - Context API can be added for shared state
   - A state management library can be introduced later if necessary

## Technical Constraints

1. **Browser Compatibility**
   - The application must work in modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)
   - Polyfills may be needed for older browsers
   - Responsive design is required for different screen sizes

2. **Performance**
   - The application must be responsive even with many items
   - Rendering should be optimized for large lists
   - State updates should be efficient

3. **Accessibility**
   - The application must be accessible to users with disabilities
   - Keyboard navigation must be supported
   - Screen readers must be able to interpret the UI

## Development Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Core Functionality (Current)**
   - Implement the basic component structure
   - Set up the modular data structure
   - Implement the data service

2. **Phase 2: Enhanced Features**
   - Implement the Library Modal
   - Add support for installing and uninstalling connectors
   - Implement persistent favorites

3. **Phase 3: Polish and Optimization**
   - Improve performance for large lists
   - Enhance accessibility
   - Add animations and transitions

4. **Phase 4: Integration**
   - Integrate with backend services
   - Implement real data fetching
   - Add authentication and authorization
