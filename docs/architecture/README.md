## Architecture Overview

The Actions Pane V4 prototype is built using React and the Fluent UI component library. It follows a modular architecture with the following key features:

1. **Component-Based Design**
   - Small, reusable components
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Consistent styling using Fluent UI

2. **Modular Data Structure**
   - Separate files for each module and connector
   - Centralized data service
   - Type-safe interfaces

3. **State Management**
   - React's built-in state management
   - State lifting for shared state
   - Props drilling for data flow

## Design Principles

The architecture is guided by the following principles:

1. **Simplicity**
   - Keep things as simple as possible
   - Avoid unnecessary complexity
   - Use built-in features when possible

2. **Modularity**
   - Break down the application into small, focused components
   - Use composition to build complex components
   - Keep related code together

3. **Maintainability**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Document key decisions and patterns
   - Follow consistent naming and coding conventions

4. **Scalability**
   - Design for future growth
   - Support a large number of modules and connectors
   - Allow for easy extension and modification

5. **Performance**
   - Optimize rendering for large lists
   - Minimize unnecessary re-renders
   - Use efficient data structures and algorithms

## Getting Started

To understand the architecture, start with the [Component Architecture](./component-architecture.md) document, which provides an overview of the component hierarchy and interfaces. Then, explore the [Data Flow](./data-flow.md) document to understand how data moves through the application. Finally, review the [Project Structure](./project-structure.md) document for implementation details and design decisions.
