# Actions Pane V4 Component Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the component architecture for the Actions Pane V4 prototype, including component hierarchy, relationships, and design patterns.

## Component Hierarchy

The Actions Pane V4 prototype follows a hierarchical component structure:

```
App
└── ActionsPane
    ├── ActionsPaneHeader
    │   └── (Fluent UI components: Input, TabList, Tab, Button)
    ├── ActionsPaneContent
    │   ├── (Fluent UI components: Accordion, Text, Button)
    │   └── ActionItem
    │       └── (Fluent UI components: Text, Button, Tooltip)
    └── LibraryEntryPoint
        └── (Fluent UI components: Text)
```

This hierarchy reflects the visual structure of the UI, with parent components containing and controlling their children.

## Component Relationships

The components in the Actions Pane V4 prototype interact through props and callbacks:

### Data Flow

1. **ActionsPane**
   - Manages state for `activeTab` and `searchQuery`
   - Passes state and callbacks to child components

2. **ActionsPaneHeader**
   - Receives `activeTab`, `onTabChange`, `searchQuery`, and `onSearchChange` props from ActionsPane
   - Calls `onTabChange` when a tab is selected
   - Calls `onSearchChange` when the search input changes

3. **ActionsPaneContent**
   - Receives `activeTab` and `searchQuery` props from ActionsPane
   - Uses these props to filter content from the data service
   - Passes item data to ActionItem components

4. **ActionItem**
   - Receives `item` prop containing action data
   - Manages its own state for favorite status

5. **LibraryEntryPoint**
   - Standalone component that will open the Library Modal (not yet implemented)

### Event Flow

1. User interacts with UI (clicks a tab, types in search, etc.)
2. Event handlers in child components call callback functions passed as props
3. Parent components update their state based on these callbacks
4. Updated state flows down to child components as props
5. Child components re-render with the new props

## Design Patterns

The Actions Pane V4 prototype uses several design patterns:

### Container/Presentation Pattern

- **Container Components**: Manage state and data (ActionsPane)
- **Presentation Components**: Render UI based on props (ActionItem)

This separation of concerns makes components more reusable and easier to test.

### Composition

Components are composed of smaller, focused components:

- ActionsPane composes ActionsPaneHeader, ActionsPaneContent, and LibraryEntryPoint
- ActionsPaneContent composes multiple ActionItem components
- All components compose Fluent UI components

### Props Drilling

Data flows down through the component hierarchy via props:

```
ActionsPane
  state: activeTab, searchQuery
  ↓
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │ ActionsPaneHeader   │
  │ props: activeTab,   │
  │ onTabChange,        │
  │ searchQuery,        │
  │ onSearchChange      │
  └─────────────────────┘
  ↓
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │ ActionsPaneContent  │
  │ props: activeTab,   │
  │ searchQuery         │
  └─────────────────────┘
  ↓
  ┌─────────────────────┐
  │ ActionItem          │
  │ props: item         │
  └─────────────────────┘
```

### Hooks

The components use React hooks for state management and side effects:

- `useState` for local component state
- `useStyles` (from Fluent UI) for component styling

### Styling Pattern

Components use Fluent UI's `makeStyles` for styling:

```jsx
const useStyles = makeStyles({
  container: {
    display: 'flex',
    // ...more styles
  },
  // ...more style objects
});

// In the component:
const styles = useStyles();
return <div className={styles.container}>...</div>;
```

This approach provides:
- Scoped styles that don't leak to other components
- TypeScript integration for style properties
- Theme awareness through Fluent UI tokens

## Component Categories

The Actions Pane V4 components can be categorized as follows:

### Layout Components

- **ActionsPane**: Main container for the Actions Pane
- **ActionsPaneHeader**: Header section with search and tabs
- **ActionsPaneContent**: Content section with action groups

### Interactive Components

- **ActionItem**: Individual action item with favorite functionality
- **LibraryEntryPoint**: Entry point to the Library Modal

### Future Components

The following components are planned for future implementation:

- **LibraryModal**: Modal for browsing and installing actions
- **ActionDetails**: Detailed view of an action
- **ActionGroup**: Grouping of related actions
- **ActionSubgroup**: Subgrouping within an action group
- **SearchResults**: Results from searching actions
- **FilterPanel**: Panel for filtering actions

## Component Evolution

The component architecture is designed to evolve over time:

### Current State

- Basic component structure with props drilling
- Local component state
- Direct data service integration

### Enhanced State Management

- React Context API for shared state
- Custom hooks for data access and state logic
- Reducer pattern for complex state updates

### Advanced Features

- Virtualized lists for performance
- Drag and drop functionality
- Keyboard navigation
- Accessibility enhancements

## Best Practices

The component architecture follows these best practices:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
   - Complex components are broken down into smaller, focused components

2. **Explicit Dependencies**
   - Components receive all dependencies as props
   - No hidden dependencies or global state access

3. **Type Safety**
   - All props and state are typed with TypeScript interfaces
   - Component interfaces are well-documented

4. **Consistent Naming**
   - Components follow a consistent naming convention
   - Props and callbacks have clear, descriptive names

5. **Fluent UI Integration**
   - Components use Fluent UI for styling and basic UI elements
   - Design tokens ensure consistency with the Fluent design system

## Conclusion

The Actions Pane V4 component architecture provides a solid foundation for building a modular, maintainable, and extensible UI. By following established design patterns and best practices, the component library can evolve to support new features and requirements while maintaining code quality and developer experience.
