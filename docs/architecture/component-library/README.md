## Component Library Overview

The Actions Pane V4 prototype uses a modular component architecture based on React and Fluent UI. The component library is designed to be:

### Modular

Components are organized into logical groups with clear responsibilities:

- **Container Components**: Manage state and data flow (e.g., `ActionsPane`)
- **Presentation Components**: Render UI based on props (e.g., `ActionItem`)
- **Composite Components**: Combine multiple components (e.g., `ActionsPaneContent`)

### Reusable

Components are designed for reusability:

- Clear interfaces with well-defined props
- Separation of concerns
- Consistent styling patterns
- Flexible composition

### Maintainable

The component library follows best practices for maintainability:

- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive documentation
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Fluent UI design system integration

## Key Design Patterns

The component library uses several key design patterns:

1. **Composition**: Components are composed of smaller, focused components
2. **Props Drilling**: Data flows down through the component hierarchy
3. **Container/Presentation Pattern**: Separation of data management and UI rendering
4. **Render Props**: For flexible component composition
5. **Hooks**: For state management and side effects

## Getting Started

To understand the component library, start with the [Component Overview](./component-overview.md) document, which provides a high-level overview of the component architecture. Then, explore the [Core Components](./core-components.md) document to understand the individual components and their responsibilities. Finally, review the [Component Usage Guide](./component-usage-guide.md) for practical examples and best practices.

## Future Enhancements

The component library will evolve over time to support new features and improve existing functionality:

1. **Enhanced State Management**: Integration with Context API and custom hooks
2. **Accessibility Improvements**: ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
3. **Performance Optimizations**: Memoization and virtualization
4. **Theming Support**: Customizable themes and styling
5. **Internationalization**: Multi-language support
