## Component Interfaces

### ActionsPane

The main container component for the Actions Pane.

**Props:**
- None

**State:**
- `activeTab: string` - The currently selected tab
- `searchQuery: string` - The current search query

**Responsibilities:**
- Manages the overall layout of the Actions Pane
- Maintains the state for active tab and search query
- Passes state and callbacks to child components

### ActionsPaneHeader

The header component containing the search box and tab navigation.

**Props:**
- `activeTab: string` - The currently selected tab
- `onTabChange: (tab: string) => void` - Callback for tab changes
- `searchQuery: string` - The current search query
- `onSearchChange: (query: string) => void` - Callback for search changes

**Responsibilities:**
- Renders the search box and tab navigation
- Handles tab selection and search input
- Passes user interactions back to parent component

### ActionsPaneContent

The main content area displaying action groups based on the selected tab and search query.

**Props:**
- `activeTab: string` - The currently selected tab
- `searchQuery: string` - The current search query

**Responsibilities:**
- Fetches and filters content based on the active tab and search query
- Renders action groups and their items
- Displays empty state when no content is available

### ActionItem

A single action item that can be clicked to perform an action.

**Props:**
- `item: ActionItemType` - The action item data

**State:**
- `isFavorite: boolean` - Whether the action is favorited

**Responsibilities:**
- Renders the action item with icon, title, and favorite button
- Handles click events for the action and favorite button
- Displays a tooltip with the action description

### LibraryEntryPoint

A component that provides access to the Library Modal.

**Props:**
- None

**Responsibilities:**
- Renders the entry point to the Library Modal
- Handles click events to open the Library Modal

## Data Models

### ActionItemType

```typescript
export interface ActionItemType {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  icon?: string;
  description?: string;
  isFavorite?: boolean;
  moduleId?: string;
}
```

### DetailedActionItem

```typescript
export interface DetailedActionItem extends ActionItemType {
  tags?: string[];
  usage?: string;
  examples?: string[];
  parameters?: {
    name: string;
    type: string;
    description: string;
    required: boolean;
  }[];
}
```

### ActionGroup

```typescript
export interface ActionGroup {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  items: ActionItemType[];
  subGroups?: ActionGroup[];
  icon?: string;
  tags?: string[];
}
```

### LibraryItemType

```typescript
export interface LibraryItemType {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  type: 'built-in' | 'connector' | 'custom' | 'ui-collection' | 'template';
  icon?: string;
  description?: string;
  author?: string;
  lastUpdated?: string;
  isInstalled: boolean;
  dependencies?: string[];
  itemCount?: number;
  actions?: ActionItemType[];
}
```

## Component Reuse Strategy

The Actions Pane V4 architecture follows these reuse principles:

1. **Atomic Design Methodology**
   - Small, single-responsibility components (ActionItem)
   - Composite components that combine smaller components (ActionGroup)
   - Container components that manage state and data flow (ActionsPane)

2. **Composition Over Inheritance**
   - Components are designed to be composed together
   - Props are used to pass data and callbacks down the component tree
   - Higher-order components are avoided in favor of composition

3. **Separation of Concerns**
   - UI components focus on rendering and user interaction
   - Data fetching and state management is handled by container components or services
   - Business logic is encapsulated in the data service

4. **Consistent Styling**
   - Fluent UI components are used for consistent styling
   - Custom styling is applied using makeStyles for component-specific styles
   - Tokens from Fluent UI are used for consistent colors, spacing, and typography

5. **Modular Data Structure**
   - Data is organized in a modular structure with separate files for each module and connector
   - Common interfaces ensure consistency across different data sources
   - The data service provides a unified API for accessing and manipulating data

## Design Patterns

1. **Container/Presentational Pattern**
   - Container components (ActionsPane) manage state and data
   - Presentational components (ActionItem) focus on rendering

2. **Compound Components**
   - Related components are grouped together (ActionGroup and its items)
   - Components share context and state when necessary

3. **Render Props**
   - Used for flexible rendering of dynamic content
   - Allows for customization of how items are rendered

4. **Controlled Components**
   - Form elements and interactive components are controlled by React state
   - State is lifted up to the appropriate level in the component hierarchy

## Future Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Virtual scrolling for large lists of actions
   - Memoization of expensive computations
   - Lazy loading of components and data

2. **Accessibility**
   - Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
   - ARIA attributes for screen readers
   - Focus management for modals and dialogs

3. **Internationalization**
   - Support for multiple languages
   - Right-to-left text direction
   - Localized formatting of dates, numbers, and currencies
